# Transformer

Given a dictionary, a source word and destination word, find a path from source to destination that goes through word transformations.
The transformation of a word defined as follows.

- Word in dictionary that can be generated by removing one letter from given word
- Word in dictionary that can be generated by replacing one letter with another
- Word in dictionary that can be generated by adding one letter at any place

# Requirements
nodejs, https://nodejs.org

# Installation
`npm install word-transformer`

# Testing
See file `client.js`

`node ./client.js`

# API
```
var TransFormer = require('word-transformer');
var transformer = new Transformer('/usr/share/dict/cracklib-small'); // This might take a while, it creates the dictionary graph

transformer.transform('cap', ate) // -> [ 'cap', 'cape', 'ape', 'ate' ]
```

# TODO
1. Facade classes that can create transformer instance from other data formats (in-memory Array, json file)
2. tests
